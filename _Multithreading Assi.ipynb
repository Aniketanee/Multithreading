    "Multithreading in Python refers to the concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single Python process. A thread is the smallest unit of execution in a program, and multithreading allows you to perform multiple tasks concurrently, making better use of multi-core processors and potentially improving the efficiency of your code for tasks that involve parallelizable operations.\n",
